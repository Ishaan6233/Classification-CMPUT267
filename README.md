# CMPUT 267: Classification with Logistic and Softmax Regression

This repository contains my solution to **Assignment 7** for **CMPUT 267: Machine Learning I**, completed as part of my coursework at the University of Alberta (Winter 2025). The assignment focuses on implementing and visualizing binary and multiclass classification models using logistic and softmax regression.

## Topics Covered
- Logistic Regression using Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)
- Sigmoid and Softmax Activation Functions
- Binary and Multiclass Cross-Entropy Loss
- Zero-One Loss Evaluation
- Polynomial Feature Transformation
- Overfitting and Generalization Visualization

## How to Run
This assignment is designed to run in **Google Colab**. To run it locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `otter-grader==6.1.0`
- `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `ipywidgets`

Then:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install otter-grader==6.1.0 scikit-learn matplotlib pandas ipywidgets
